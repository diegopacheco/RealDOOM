 

CURRENT TODO
  FRAME 1595 z a bit different

 
? why was there a 0 allocation (might be e1m1 marker etc?)
 
IMPROVEMENTS
  - mobj in conventional?
  - sectors, lines in conventional?

MEMORY IMPROVEMENTS
 - segs to conventional after all?
 - more shorts to ints in lines etc
 - reuse local variables to create fewer
 - create a 'getter' function that just grabs a value from memory without paging somehow?




... BUGS TO FIX
 - save file stuff (archive, unarchive thinkers)
 - test doom 2 stuff



TODO 
 

! illegal reads?

- get rid of:
  ~ rest of enums?
  ~ net?
  - dump bad savegame code
  - see if we can lessen size of some of those sectors etc fields
  - audio_wf removal? dpmi code?
  ? cut trig tables in half or 1/4th, add small extra code when using it?
 


- make titlepic work with > 4 pages?
- types.h stuff

- remove rangecheck (after doom2 testing?)
- remove disk reading icon (?)

MEMORY IDEAS


TESTING:
 - finale  
 - viles and other enemy (heads, head spawns)

? change crossbspnode etc to use indices not addressesma
