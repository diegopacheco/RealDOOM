  - mobj in conventional?
  - sectors, lines in conventional?

MEMORY IMPROVEMENTS
 - segs to conventional after all?
 - more shorts to ints in lines etc
 - reuse local variables to create fewer
 - create a 'getter' function that just grabs a value from memory without paging somehow?




KNOWN ISSUES
 - no sound, need new 16 bit lib
 - no titlepic, etc. requires 65k allocation, 64k currently _maxammo
 - time counter on level finish is wrong
 - doom2 enemies probably nonfunctional, needs testing
 - savegames broken. not sure if it will be compatible with original doom

TODO 
 
 ? is 2048 mem entries enough? plays demo 1 ok.
 x shrink the allocation_t a bit more
 x setup git
 ~ make ems actually work
 x build 16 bit for good
 ~ set visiplanes under 64k and see if large compile works
 1 change a bunch of int_32t to int_16t, see if it still works
   ~ wad  
   ~ zone
   - video fields (bounding box etc)
 2 change fixed_t stuff
 - temp disable screen2/3 wipe?
 - get rid of backbuffer? or make it ems

 - test level transitions some more.
 - see if we can lessen size of some of those sectors etc fields
 - integrate asm based EMS implementation from catacombs 3d or somewhere else see https://github.com/CatacombGames/Catacomb3D/blob/aa97f4995dc7dbea3ecc1794a2d4d4354839cad4/ID_MM.C#L147

 IMPROVEMENTS
 ? clean up 0 allocation checking code
 - TEST DOOM2 STUFF
   ? remove rangecheck (after doom2 testing?)
 ? remove disk reading icon (?)
 - save file fixes
 - make titlepic work with > 4 pages?
 - investigate runtime improvements in z_zone.


- get rid of:
  ? more enums
  ? any more net code to dump?
  ? dump bad savegame code
  



MEMORY IDEAS
 
 ~ compress memory allocation entries by using bit masks and combining values
 - support allocating some things in conventional memory. 
   - probably need to use it to support titlepic and other large memory things?
   - test to figure out which variables improve fps most in conventional
      - probably sectors, lines, etc...

 - use overlays, especially on startup code to eliminate space
   - if we ever do multiple renderers or sound code etc, 
        can fit more in the binary by using overlays?
 - go thru all int32_ts and make as many int16_t as possible
 - explicitly declare things near, far when possible?
 - reduce visiplanes size below 65k somehow to allow large instead of huge memory model.
   - maybe just reduce the number of visplanes for now...
 - pull strings into ems at runtime by loading from a file rather than compiling
   as data alongside code.  strings are generally used once every blue moon, and 
   d_english.h has got about 15k worth of data sitting there..
  several dozen frames at the most so doesnt make sense for them to be in conventional
  and sectors being paged in and out... 
 - look into using the sourceHint to allocate items with some sort of locality to 
    decrease pagination. rather than marking blocks themselves as reserved,
    probably maintain a fixed list of preferred pages by type, and use that as 
    a temporary rover head for the allocation. mobj for sure would benefit from
    this. can probably benchmark by pagination count and try and lower that number.
 - investigate benefits of fewer bigger source files (less far calls?)

 

TESTING:
 - finale  
 - doom2... viles and other enemy (heads, head spawns)
